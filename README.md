HW04 â€” RPS-card (deadline: 2015-09-10)
===

Make a C++ modified card-based Rock-paper-scissors game. This is similar to KH: Chain of Memories.

Mechanics
====
* Each player is allocated 15 cards.
  * Two of the cards are jokers. (the "0" cards)
  * The rest are labeled 1 to 13.
* Each player uses a card to "joust".
  * The jousts will keep on going until all cards are used up. So there will be 15 rounds/jousts in total.
  * A player gets a point only when he wins the joust. For a draw, no points will be given to any player.
* Except for the jokers, a higher card beats a lower card. But 1 beats 13 (i.e. 1 loses to every normal card except 13). For example:
  * 2 beats 1
  * 3 beats 2
  * 10 beats 1
  * 13 beats 12
  * 12 beats 1
  * 1 beats 13
* The jokers randomly wins or loses against the other card.
  * If both players chose jokers, then there's 50% chance of a draw, 25% chance of the the first player winning, and 25% chance of the other player winning.


Format
====
The "card select" screen looks like this:
```
A - Available cards: 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
a>
```
For player B, replace `A -` and `a>` appropriately.

Each card may only by used once, so once a card is used, it should not show up in the list of available cards.

After player A selects a card, the screen should clear (try using [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32008479) to "clear" the screen) and print:

```
Press enter when player B is ready...
```
When enter is pressed, the screen is cleared and the card select screen for B is shown.
Once player B selects a card, the screen gets cleard and the joust gets resolved:

```
Joust: [a card] vs [b card]
[win line]
Press enter when player A is ready...
```
where `[a card]` is the card that player A selected, and `[b card]` is the card that player B selected.

The `[win line]` can be one of the following:
 * `Player A wins!`
 * `Player B wins!`
 * `Both players draw!`

If either player uses the joker (`0`) card, the `[win line]` changes to: 
 * `Player A wins by chance!`
 * `Player B wins by chance!`
 * `Both players draw by chance!`

When enter is pressed, the screen gets cleared and we're back to the card select screen of A.

At the last joust, when all cards are used, the end line looks like
```
Player A: [a points]
Player B: [b points]
**[win line]**
```
Where `[a points]` is the total points of player A and `[b points]` is the total points of player B. `[win line]` states who won overall and the format is the same as the previous one (though note the additional asterisks).

Sample
====


```
A - Available cards: 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
a>
```

Player A selects `4`

```
Press enter when player B is ready...
```

```
B - Available cards: 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
b>
```
Player B selects `0`

```
Joust: 4 vs 0
Player B wins by chance!
Press enter when player A is ready...
```

```
A - Available cards: 0 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
a>
```
Player A selects `1`

```
Press enter when player B is ready...
```

```
B - Available cards: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
b>
```
Player B selects `12`

```
Joust: 1 vs 12
Player B wins!
Press enter when player A is ready...
```

Etc.

Then when all cards are exhausted:

```
Joust: 0 vs 0
Both players draw by chance!
Player A: 4
Player B: 10
**Player B wins!**
```
